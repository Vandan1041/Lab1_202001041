#Q.1. Identify FRs and NFRs:
The institute has been recently set up to provide state-of-the-art research facilities in the field of Software Engineering. Apart from research scholars (students) and professors, it also includes quite a large number of employees who work on different projects undertaken by the institution. As the size and capacity of the institute is increasing with the time, it has been proposed to develop a Library Information System (LIS) for the benefit of students and employees of the institute. LIS will enable the members to borrow a book (or return it) with ease while sitting at his desk/chamber. The system also enables a member to extend the date of his borrowing if no other booking for that particular book has been made. For the library staff, this system aids them to easily handle day-to-day book transactions. The librarian, who has administrative privileges and complete control over the system, can enter a new record into the system when a new book has been purchased, or remove a record in case any book is taken off the shelf. Any non-member is free to use this system to browse/search books online. However, issuing or returning books is restricted to valid users (members) of LIS only. The final deliverable would be a web application (using the recent HTML 5), which should run only within the institute LAN. Although this reduces security risk of the software to a large extent, care should be taken no confidential information (eg., passwords) is stored in plain text.

Functional Requirements:
1.Allows members to borrow and return books from their desks/chambers.
2.Enables a member to extend the date of his borrowing if no other booking for that particular book has been made.
3.Allows the librarian to enter new records and remove records from the system.
4.Allows non-members to browse and search books online.
5.Restricts issuing and returning books to valid members only.

Non Functional Requirements:
1.Should be scalable to incorporate the increasing size of institute.
2.Libararian should be given complete administrative privileges and complete control over the system.
3.Ensures that confidential information (e.g. passwords) is not stored in plain text for security reasons.
4.Reduce the security risk of the software.
5.Runs only within the institute LAN.
6.Delivers a web application using HTML 5.

#Q2 Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.
Approximately 5% of the world population (or a staggering 466 million people) suffers from disabling hearing loss. We set out to create an impactful solution for this community that addresses some of their everyday needs. Our mobile application uses artificial intelligence to recognize key sound events of interest to this community, such as car horns and babies, where immediate alerts and continual logging are critical for the user. This app is optimized for Android with low-latency so that it works in real-time for use.
